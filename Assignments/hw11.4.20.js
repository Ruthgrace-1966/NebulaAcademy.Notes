//INSTRUCTIONS
 

// PROBLEM #1

// Create a function that checks the type of the argument as well as if the argument is an array or not

// IF it is a string, return the string passed in as the argument

// IF it is a number, return the number passed in as the argument

// IF it is a boolean, return the boolean passed in as the argument

// IF it is an array, return the array passed in as the argument

 

// PROBLEM #2

// Create a function that takes in 2 parameters: num1 and num2

// IF both of the numbers passed into the function as arguments are greater than 50, then return num1*num2

// IF both of the numbers are less then 50, add the two numbers : return num1+num2

// IF one of the numbers is greater than 50 and the other is less than 50, divide the two numbers: return num1/num2

 

// PROBLEM #3

// Create a function that that takes in 2 parameters that are numbers.

// IF the first number divided by the second number has a remainder, return the string: 'the remainder if (num1) divided by (num2) is (remainder)

// IF there is no remainder, return the string: '(num1) divided by (num2) has no remainders'

 

// PROBLEM #4

// Create a function that takes in a string. This function will calculate the length of any string passed into this function.

// IF the length of the string is an odd number, return the string: 'the length of (string) is an odd number'

// IF it is an even number, return the string: 'the length of (string) is an even number'

 

// PROBLEM #5

// Create a function that takes in an array. This function calculates the length of the array.

// IF the length of the array is even, remove the last element of the array, add a new element at the beginning of the array and return the new array

// IF the length of the array is od, remove the first element of the array, add a new element to the end of the array and return the new array
